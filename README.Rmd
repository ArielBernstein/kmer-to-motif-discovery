title: "Detecting Sequence Motifs Associated with Continuous Biological Traits"
---

## Overview

This project implements an R-based pipeline for detecting sequence motifs associated
with **continuous biological traits**, without discretizing the data into binary
labels. The approach combines k-mer–level statistical association testing with
downstream processing that aggregates significant k-mers into biologically
interpretable sequence motifs.

Conceptually, the full pipeline includes sequence input, k-mer matrix construction,
statistical testing and motif discovery. Due to authorship
constraints, the k-mer matrix generation and statistical testing steps are not
included here; therefore, the full pipeline cannot be run end-to-end, and each script
is designed to be run independently.

For full methodological details and results, see the accompanying report.

## What this repository provides

- **`from_kmers_to_motifs.R`**  
  Post-processing pipeline that converts precomputed significant k-mers into sequence
  motifs using genomic window merging, distance-based clustering, and multiple
  sequence alignment.

- **`simulate_genome.R`**  
  A controlled genome simulation framework used to generate all data analyzed in
  this repository.

  The primary purpose of the simulation is to systematically evaluate where the
  k-mer–based algorithm succeeds and where it fails. By providing full control over
  key parameters—such as motif structure, prevalence, strength of effect on the
  biological trait, background sequence composition, and noise—the simulation enables
  isolation of individual factors and analysis of their impact on detection power and
  motif recovery.


- **`power_analysis.R`**  
  Standalone power analysis of KS and Mann–Whitney tests under varying effect sizes     and multiple-testing regimes.  
  This script is independent of the main pipeline and addresses methodological
  questions related to statistical testing.

## Environment setup (renv)

This project uses renv to ensure reproducible package versions.
To recreate the analysis environment:

```r
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

This command installs the exact R package versions specified in renv.lock, allowing
the code to be run without manual dependency management.

## Context

This work was developed as part of research conducted in a computational genetics
laboratory (Dr. Michal Rabani, Department of Genetics).
